loading_phrase = The second single off of her debut album "SOUR", this song finds Olivia at a different stage than her first single, "drivers license", as she begins to move on from heartbreak. She questions the authenticity of her ex's new relationship, as well as their emotions for their new girl as she portrays feelings of pity against her. Fun fact: "deja vu" draws influences melodically and lyrically to Taylor Swift's 2019 song, "Cruel Summer."
