loading_phrase = The band's most popular song. This song was originally titled 'Suicide,' but Colombia Records made them change it to be more radio friendly. It was renamed to 'Chop Suey!,' the name of a Chinese Dish, as a play on words (suey-cide), and to draw similarities of the thrown-togetherness of the dish and the musical style of the song. Guitarist Daron Malakian says 'The song is about how when people die, they will be regarded differently depending on the way they pass.'
